# Key Re-Installation Attacks

Woah, I bet it's been a while since you read anything about KRACK, right? I imagine (for those who were interested in the initial paper) you read the follow up paper in October 2018, if you were not that interested then well, you probably thought this vulnerability was done with and to be honest - it pretty much is.Nonetheless today I'm going to be talking about it, not because I want to relight old news but because I had a really interesting experience with getting the POC working.
