# Introduction

Hey! I thought I'd be like everyone else and do a "my oscp journey" blog series kinda' thing, I don't know if anyone is interested in this shit really but hey, its a thing in the OSCP scene so I figured why not throw my hat into it too.

This post is technically not really about the OSCP as I've not started at the time of writing this, instead this post focuses more the building of my VM environment, some preparation materials I am using and the like - so all interesting stuff really!

## VMWare Build

Let's first talk about my VM setup! I'm using VMWare Workstation Pro on my "pen-testing" laptop, that's really just a fancy title for my laptop to be honest; we'll refer to her as Mia for the rest of this post because as you all know, I'm her biggest fan don't @ me, kthx.

I guess one of the more "interesting" pieces of software I'm using is Barrier, if you don't know what [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) is or you've never heard of it before; its a network-based KVM forked from Synergy by Symless! Pretty cool software actually, it allows me to well, KVM over the network. This way I can use my main PC and use the same mouse & keyboard on my laptop! I for sure recommend for anyone to check out Barrier, especially as its free & open-source as opposed to Synergy being like $20.

## Preparation

I thought it would be good for me to cover some things I've been doing in order to prepare for the exam, for example what vulneable VMs I've been doing, what HackTheBox boxes, what notes I've been taking, etc.
