## Introduction

So, in the last two posts we covered two different monoalphabetic ciphers - the Caeser cipher and the Affine cipher, in the next posts we're going to look at cryptanalysis of monoalphabetic ciphers and some different types of attacks we can look at specifically for Caeser & Affine and some more general techniques.

### Brute Force Attacks

The most known type of a cryptanalysis attack is a "brute force attack" and the premise is very simple; do some computation over & over again until you get the original result; with modern ciphers this is what we call "computationally infeasible" i.e; it's computationally inefficient/impossible for us to carry out this attack and get the result we want; that result being the original/plaintext message.

Now, how does a brute force attack work? Well, it's quite simple let's take a look. We will take **all possible** keys and we will try to use those keys to recover the original message based on the ciphertext this can also be known as an "exhaustive key search"; I much prefer this term to "brute force attack" but both work, I guess, depends how pedantic you're feeling! :D
