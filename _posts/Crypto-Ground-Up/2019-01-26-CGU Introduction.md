I am **not** a Cryptographer, I am **not** a Cryptography student, Cryptology is **not** my discipline. Please note that there is no guarantee that everything in this series of blog posts is/will be correct, I cannot be held accountable for you implementing a poor crypto system because you decided to do no further reading than my posts. Crypto is a very hard discipline, it takes years & years to get it **right.** Just keep this in mind when reading my posts, thanks! With that said, I will do my absolute best to ensure that every post is 100% accurate!

## Introduction

Over the next few months I'm going to attempt to teach a very basic cryptography course in a series of blog posts, from the ground up. For those that don't know me, I'm a massive crypto nerd, something about it is so fascinating and I 'd love to share that passion I have with everyone else and maybe at the same time learning some things I did not know already or teach some people things they did not know! Well, that is the goal of this blog anyway, I guess. 

I really don't know how I'm actually going to teach this yet, I'm just going to wing it and do my best to get everything correct, I guess we might start off with some basic mathematical formulas, etc but we'll see! It might take a while to get the first post out following this post simply because I want to be weeks ahead so I can get things right and give myself time to double & triple check my work! 

Thanks for reading, hopefully this should be a fun journey!
