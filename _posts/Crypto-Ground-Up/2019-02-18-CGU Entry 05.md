I am **not** a Cryptographer, I am **not** a Cryptography student, Cryptology is **not** my discipline. Please note that there is no guarantee that everything in this series of blog posts is/will be correct, I cannot be held accountable for you implementing a poor crypto system because you decided to do no further reading than my posts. Crypto is a very hard discipline, it takes years & years to get it **right.** Just keep this in mind when reading my posts, thanks! With that said, I will do my absolute best to ensure that every post is 100% accurate!

## Introduction

Ah, math, math, math I know how much all of you love math! And in light of that, today we're going to talk about Integer Rings - you might be sat in your chair after reading my last blog posts thinking "Linxz, you've taught us all this math and not shown any application or why it's important, I'm sure you're just teasing us" and you're entitled to think that - but I promise, after this post you're going to see why I explained all of this math to you and then you'll understand how we actually use the math. Trust me, last math post! (for now...)

## Integer Rings

So, Integer Rings! What are they? What do they do? Why are we learning about this? Well, I'll answer all these questions now just slow down and give me a chance :p
