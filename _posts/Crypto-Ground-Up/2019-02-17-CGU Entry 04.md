Please note that there is no guarantee that everything in this series of blog posts is/will be correct, I cannot be held accountable for you implementing a poor crypto system because you decided to do no further reading than my posts. Crypto is a very hard discipline, it takes years & years to get it **right.** Just keep this in mind when reading my posts, thanks! With that said, I will do my absolute best to ensure that every post is 100% accurate!

## Introduction

Now, last post we talked about modulo and if you remember at the end I told you that the fact the remainder is not unique runs much deeper than just a coincidence and as such I'm going to introduce you to what we call equivalence classes. If you have not already, I highly advise you go back & read the last post as if you don't you might have a hard time understanding what I am talking about here or what this means for us & cryptography.

## Equivalence Classes

So as a recap of the last post, you might/should remember that we looked at some basic congruence modulo examples and we came to the conclusion that the remainder is **not** unique, let's take a look at another example so that I can introduce to you the idea of a equivalence class.

$$ A = 12 $$

$$ M = 5 $$

Remember, we look at how many times the 5 fits into the 12 and as such we can write this as

$$ 12 ≡ 2 mod 5 $$

and we can do our check that we did before by writing $ 5|(12-2) $ and as I'm sure you're aware, 5 does divide 10 so that is correct. But remember, we said the remainder is not unique so we could also write this as

$$ 12 ≡ 7 mod 5 \quad \text{check} \; 5|(12-7) $$

and like before we can go into negative numbers if we so wish

$$ 12 ≡ -3 mod 5 \quad \text{check} \; 5|(12-(-3)) $$

and what you should have observed here is that we can define an infinite set here with a gap of 5 between all of the numbers. In other words, the below is an equivalence class for modulo 5. It is important to know that all the elements of this class will behave equivalent modulo 5 and we will now move onto what this actually means.

$$ \{..., -8, -3, 2, 7, 12, 17, ...\} $$

The observant of you might have noticed I said "an equivalence class for modulo 5" and if you did notice I said that, well done - so what does this mean? Well, it means that there is more than just one equivalence class for modulo 5 and now I'm going to show you all of them.
