I am **not** a Cryptographer, I am **not** a Cryptography student, Cryptology is **not** my discipline. Please note that there is no guarantee that everything in this series of blog posts is/will be correct, I cannot be held accountable for you implementing a poor crypto system because you decided to do no further reading than my posts. Crypto is a very hard discipline, it takes years & years to get it **right.** Just keep this in mind when reading my posts, thanks! With that said, I will do my absolute best to ensure that every post is 100% accurate!

## Introduction

In Cryptography, modulo is pretty much everywhere, it is an incredibly powerful mathematical function yet all it does is find the remainder after the division of one number by another - so how does it work? And, why do we use it? Today we're going to answer these questions so that you understand how modulo works before we dive into cryptosystems that take advantage of modulo which by the way, is quite a lot.

## Modular Arithmetic

So, let us first look at modular arithmetic or "Modular Computation" (Arithmetic is a fancy word for computation). In Cryptography our goal is to work in Finite sets, not always but **most** of the time we aim to do computation in Finite sets. You may be wondering, what is a Finite set? Well, to answer that question we can give a very, very simple example - a clock is a finite set which is why you will often see Modular Arithmetic visualised in a clock as using a clock or even just a circle makes it very simple for us to visualise a finite set!

Now that we have established we can visualise this in a clock, let's do a very simple visualisation exercise of some modular arithmetic using some small numbers and a circle/clock face.

As you can see above, there is our clock, now let me show you why it is nice to visualise modular arithmetic in a clock/circle like this. So, if I asked you to do 12+20 in normal mathematics you would tell me the answer is 32 and you'd be correct, but let's imagine if we did 12+20 on the clock, well, there is no 32 hour - so how would we do this? Well, we would start at 12 and we'd go round the clock by 20 hours and the hour we land on would be the new time in our case the new time would be 8 o'clock.
