### Introduction

Between June 30th - July 1st 2011 a backdoor was introduced into the vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz archive this backdoor allowed an attacker to get a bind shell to the system and thus compromising the system. Although the backdoor was removed quickly (July 3rd 2011) a lot of people downloaded this vulnerable version of VSFTPD, causing quite a lot of panic for sysadmins.

### So, how does it work?
