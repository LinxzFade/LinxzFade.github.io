# Introduction

Well, I wish I could start this post by saying "a lot of people asked me - what is it like to run an infosec community?" but, I can't start the post like that because nobody has ever asked haha!

## Background

If you don't know, I run two InfoSec communities on the Discord platform, the first is the HackTheBox Discord which is entirely dedicated to the HackTheBox platform and is run by me & others on a volunteer basis in order to provide another communication stream for the users of HackTheBox. The other is FreeSec which is a Discord community focused around well, freedom, I guess. FreeSec is part-owned by me and someone I met via the HackTheBox Discord.
