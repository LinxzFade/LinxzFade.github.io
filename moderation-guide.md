## Roles Explained

### Support

As support you're expected to keep an eye on keeping channels on-topic, making sure there is no arguments getting out of hand and keeping
users in check in general. As a result support users have the ability to warn users and purge however you cannot kick or ban users.

### Moderator

As a moderator you're expected to be there for support users to escalate to, keep an eye on #roles so that users get the ranks they require, due to this you have the ability to assign roles, kick, ban, purge and warn users
